I'm more of a solutionist than a critic. Unhinged ideas come naturally.

I'll dump my personal thoughts here. I think about fundamental aspects of people and society, specifically politics and
societal systems with touches of solutions sprinkled throughout. I also like thinking about highly glorified status
symbols and why people should be looking in other directions. I also post unhinged thoughts in my daily life.

Americans live in bubbles, from liberal suburbs, finance crazed cities, religious rural communities, status seeking
beaches, and the list goes on. There are a lot of problems in the world, but personally, as an American, I ponder a lot
about US politics with a heavy bias towards benefiting the US only.

Here are a few examples of what I might post about:

- Human Systems: Revolutions are a breakdown of systems, returning people to being primal; revolutions is a physical
  war; it can be peaceful, but the victor is always the most violent. All revolutions, not protests, result in a
  further government bias or a reformed, incomplete system by the people.
- Life Goal: Rebuilding a city and setting a new vision for the US through Urban Planning and Human Dynamics
  - The US has lost touch with what is innovation. We've outsourced the very nature of accelerating society which is
    manufacturing. Software is an act of automation and efficiency, but it is not naturally inventive. We're human,
    after all, and we live in a physical world.
  - Unfortunately, the US population is spread thinly. The rate of knowledge exchange is inefficient, even in the wild
    west that is the Internet. Concentrated energy can do miracles like sending Man to the moon.
    We've seen it happen in the Islamic Golden Age with the openness for diversity, Shen Zhen's high exchange of
    hardware knowledge, Silicon Valley's esteemed software engineers, even college campuses or China's special economic
    zones -- concentrations of people resulting in spectacular innovation can not only be explained by simple economic
    theory of competition but also through physics
  - Detroit is tearing down 140,000 abandoned homes. This is new ground for experimenting infrastructure in a sandbox
    where economic activity still thrives. Environments affect how people act, from psychological bureaucracies to
    physically demanding communities. How do we make living as easy as possible to make innovation splurge?
  - Example idea: The unavoidable necessity for people is food, and nutritious food is not only expensive but also
    laborious. A city can make food for people and deliver straight to one's home. [PipeDream labs](https://www.pipedreamlabs.co/) wants to build small tunnels underneath cities to
    transport goods as quickly as possible in dense areas. If a city makes food for its residents, it not gives people,
    especially mothers or high-energy young adults in their 20's, time to do personally benefitting activities like
    starting a company or learning a new skill, but also reduces the cost of food through bulk goods purchased.
    - How is this possible? Detroit is tearing down 140,000 abandoned homes. This is new ground for experimenting
      infrastructure in a sandbox where economic activity still thrives. Environments affect how people act, from
      psychological bureaucracies to physically demanding communities.
  - How does one rebuild a city: a refocus on education
- Status Symbols: Venture Capital is a pyramid scheme. Startup world hype like AI/LLMs is fundamentally software making
  the world slightly more efficient; what progresses society is hardware and infrastructure techniques. Society will
  always need to balance invention with short term self-interest, i.e. money. With concentrated energy, we can see
  society shifting.
- Unhinged thoughts: I was shopping during the Times 100 event in NYC, and I was thinking: there must be so much food
  waste. I could probably gather 100 illegal immigrants to storm the event by overpowering the limited security: they
  not only will get free food but also less than a few hours in a jail and ruining a nepotist's event.
  - Also, I don't get why children are in subways expecting people will pay for the candy; their families could've been
    swindled, but their best option is to go to Central Park where kids can learn English, have fun, and sell more. It's
    unfortunate what migrants are going through; if only the US invested in Latin America's manufacturing infrastructure
    (unless the military is worried that a richer Latin America means possible military threats, then I digress; 
    regardless, China has already won the region, so I expect nukes there anyway in the next two decades).
- Human Dynamics: the mind is very powerful, especially when it comes to religion, but human nature lends itself towards
  unnatural male societies. Nature requires balance, and male dominating societies, the one many ultra conservatives
  around the world seek from 1940s Samurai-seeking Japan to Far Right Christians, will find themselves embroiled in
  conflict and abuse and misfortune for women.
- Politics: Antonin Scalia is misinterpreted. His conservative politics lend him to being an originalist, but he has
  a governing rather than a political ideology (though bias remains) for Congress to be more proactive and for judges
  to solely interpret based on existing laws, which should be repealed or appended.
