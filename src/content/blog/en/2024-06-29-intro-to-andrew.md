I'm more of a solutionist than a critic. Unhinged ideas come naturally.

I'll dump my personal thoughts here. I think about fundamental aspects of people and society, specifically politics and
societal systems with touches of solutions sprinkled throughout. I also like thinking about highly glorified status
symbols and why people should be looking in other directions. I also post unhinged thoughts in my daily life.

Americans live in bubbles, from liberal suburbs, finance crazed cities, religious rural communities, status seeking
beaches, and the list goes on. There are a lot of problems in the world, but personally, as an American, I ponder a lot
about US politics with a heavy bias towards benefiting the US only.

Here are a few examples of what I might post about:

## Human Systems

Revolutions are a breakdown of systems, returning people to being primal; revolutions are attritious physical
wars; the victor is always the most violent, and the level of violence differs. All revolutions, not protests, result
in a further government bias or a reformed, incomplete system by the people.

## Life Goal

Rebuilding a city and setting a new vision for the US through Urban Planning and Human Dynamics.

The US has lost touch with what is innovation. We've outsourced the very nature of an accelerating society which is
manufacturing. Lots of money have refocused on software which is an act of automation and efficiency. It is not
innately inventive. We're human, after all, and we live in a physical world.

How can the US start innovating again? It needs to:

1. Refocus on manufacturing leading to innovation
2. Concentrate people and thus knowledge in dense areas to accelerate innovation

Our pace of innovation is limited by the US being spread thin. The rate of knowledge exchange is inefficient, even in
the wild west that is the Internet. Concentrated energy can do miracles like sending Man to the moon. Dense cities
result in innovation which can be explained by simple economic theory of competition and physics.

[The sun emits high energy photons for life to process](https://youtu.be/DxL2HoqLbyA?si=38rWlQaLE90cxVhR&t=890). The
output of humans dissipate the energy; if we concentrate energy, we compound the output of knowledge and innovation we
seek.

For instance, the Abbasid Caliphate's openness for diversity resulted in the Islamic Golden Age; muslim immigrants to
Baghdad fostered communities of academics. Dense cities are porous for knowledge. The greater the average knowledge of
people, then more people can achieve innovation. The Internet has high traffic websites but is inherently decentralized.
We need a physical place for people to live, and it must be shaped for innovators.

Shen Zhen's high exchange of hardware knowledge and ignorance for patents solidifies the city as the capital of new
innovation. The design of the city, from its transportation infrastructure to the city's laws, catalyzed its
manufacturing speed and engineering population growth.

Planning for long term growth isn't aligned with America's view with free market capitalism. In fact, there is no
example of urban planning in the US that was built specifically to cater towards the growth of any industry. The perfect
place to test this is Detroit. Detroit is tearing down 140,000 abandoned homes. This is new ground for experimenting
infrastructure in a sandbox where economic activity still thrives. A sandbox enables planners to shape how the residents
view its city and thus each other. Environments affect how people act, from psychological bureaucracies to
physically demanding communities.

If Detroit were to cater to innovators, how do we make living as easy as possible to make innovation splurge?

Example idea: An unavoidable necessity for life is food, and nutritious food is not only expensive but also
laborious to prepare. A city can make food for people, use taxes to subsidize this, and deliver straight to one's
home: [PipeDream labs](https://www.pipedreamlabs.co/) wants to build small tunnels underneath cities to transport goods
as quickly as possible in dense areas. If a city makes food for its residents, it not only gives people, especially
mothers or high-energy young adults in their 20's, time to do personally benefitting activities like starting a company
or learning a new skill, but also reduces the cost of food through bulk goods purchased.

## Status Symbols

[Venture capital is a pyramid scheme](/blog/2024-06-30-venture-capital-is-a-pyramid-scheme/). Startup world hype like
AI/LLMs is fundamentally software making the world slightly more efficient; what progresses humanity is new hardware
and infrastructure techniques. Society will always need to balance invention with short term self-interest, i.e. money,
but society must refocus on a centralized goal and concentrated energy in order to leap.

## Unhinged thoughts

I was shopping during the Times 100 event in NYC, and I was thinking: there must be so much food
waste. I could probably gather 100 illegal immigrants to storm the event by overpowering the limited security: they
not only will get free food but also less than a few hours in a jail and ruining a nepotist's event.

Also, I don't get why migrant children are in subways expecting people will pay for the candy; their families could've
been swindled into thinking candy selling works, but their best option is to go to Central Park where kids can learn
English, have fun, and sell more: a double whammy. It's unfortunate what migrants are going through; if only the US
invested in Latin America's manufacturing infrastructure (unless the military is worried that a richer Latin America
means possible military threats, then I digress; regardless, China has already won the region, so I expect nukes there
anyway in the next two decades).

## Human Dynamics

The mind is very powerful, especially when it comes to religion, but human nature lends itself towards unnatural male
societies. Nature requires balance, and male dominating societies, the one many ultra conservatives around the world
seek from 1940s Samurai-seeking Japan to Far Right Christians in the West, will find themselves embroiled in conflict
and abuse of women.

## Politics

Justice Antonin Scalia is misinterpreted. His conservative politics lend him to being an originalist, but he has
a governing rather than a political ideology (though bias remains) for Congress to be more proactive and for judges
to solely interpret based on existing laws, which should be repealed or appended.
